## Concept 
A 3D immersive experience that allows the user to create a task list or to carry out the tasks virtually. A member-based website, where the user can log into your account to be placed into a virtual environment. The user can choose a building that aligns with the tasks they need to do. Once inside the building the user is presented with a task list they can add, edit, and delete tasks that correspond to the chosen building. We want to create a fun alternative to task management. 
​

## User Stories
AS a USER, 
I want an interactive task list experience,
SO THAT,
I can keep track of my daily activities in a fun way.

## Acceptance Criteria 
WHEN I visit the website/app,
I am asked to sign up/log in to my task list account,
THEN I am placed in a virtual environment where I can choose a building to enter,
WHERE I am presented with a task list corresponding to that location.
